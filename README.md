=================

### An application demonstrating simple MV* architecture on top of Backbone.js framework as well as one of basic algorithms in bioinformatics - [overlap graph](http://rosalind.info/problems/grph) generation.

Solution stack:
  - [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) as core MV* framework
  - [Lodash](http://lodash.com) instead of Undersocre for better performance and cross-browser consistency
  - [jQuery](http://jquery.com) for DOM manipulation in views
  - [Bower](http://bower.io) for bootstrapping 3rd-party dependencies
  - [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) for dependency management and modular app structure
